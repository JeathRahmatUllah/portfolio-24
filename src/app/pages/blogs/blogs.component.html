        The role of Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering
      </h1>
      <br>

          Artificial Intelligence is one of the oldest concepts, originating
          from ancient times and myths. However, it was not until the 20th
          century when old ideas and crude prototypes got practical realization.
          Many prominent mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists
          joined their efforts to define the concepts of “reasoning” and
          “learning” in the context of computers. The works of Alan Turing,
          Arthur Samuel, Tom M. Mitchell, and many others created the base for
          the progress of AI and ML technologies and computer algorithms and
          programming languages in general. The generally recognized features
          that define AI are the ability to solve complex problems and the
          ability to generate information based on the source parameters. This
          way, researchers focus on the similarities between “human” thinking
          and “machine” thinking. Artificial Intelligence also should have the
          ability to learn, with human supervision or without it.

          Thanks to the rapid progress of AI and ML technologies, they have been
          successfully integrated into many key areas of modern life. For
          example, the bond between AI and software development turned into
          two-way beneficial cooperation. This means that Artificial
          Intelligence has two major layers of interaction with software
          engineering. It is an immensely useful tool that helps developers with
          numerous tasks. An AI paired with great computational power and data
          storage capabilities easily outperforms human abilities. It is an
          object of software developers’ labor. Software engineers are often
          tasked to create an AI for specific purposes or to integrate an
          existing AI into a solution that is being developed. Whether you're a
          seasoned software engineer or a curious AI enthusiast, this blog post
          aims to provide insights into the symbiotic relationship between
          software engineering and artificial intelligence.

        The Impact of Agile Development on Modern Software Engineering
      </h1>
      <br>

      <div class="text-xl ">

          Agile development has become a cornerstone in modern software
          engineering methodologies. The Agile Manifesto, with its emphasis on
          individuals and interactions, has reshaped the way teams collaborate
          and deliver software products. Agile practices such as Scrum and
          Kanban provide a flexible framework that adapts to changing
          requirements and fosters iterative development.

          In this blog post, we'll explore the key principles of Agile
          development and their impact on software engineering processes. From
          user stories and sprints to continuous integration and feedback loops,
          Agile methodologies have revolutionized the way teams approach
          software development. We'll also discuss challenges and best practices
          for implementing Agile in various projects.
